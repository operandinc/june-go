[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/operandinc/june-go.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/operandinc/june-go)

A simple, unofficial Go SDK for [June](https://june.so). Built for realistic Go systems (i.e. backed by a worker pool of goroutines with configurable buffer sizes and worker counts), and has no external dependencies. Tested and working in production at [Operand](https://operand.ai).
